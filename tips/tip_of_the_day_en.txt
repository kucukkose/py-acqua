If you're at your first equipement of an aquarium you must follow this advices.
Before putting  the water you should already have an idea of the fish that you will insert in. 
This because every fish have his own esigences and then we have to know if the water of our basin have to be more or less strong. Try to now what values has the water of your tape and than cut it with osmosis water or demineralizated. Another way is to take all osmosis water and than, with the salts that we find in acquariofilia's shops, take it at the wanted values.
After a couple of days, when the waters values will be stabilized and it will be the correct temperature, you can start to put in the plants, the more you put in, the better it is.
Other two days and you can start to put in some fish.
I suggest you to insert only one phytophagous (eat- seaweed), and one or two cleaner as the corydoras, in that way you can take under control the seaweed that normally form themselves in an aquarium just started, to eliminate all the remainder of food and to contribute to the maturation of the filter, for that you can also use some product that accelerate the development of the bacteria in the filter.
After ten days, you can insert some other fish and, slowly, put in those that you want but remember  that the less fish you put in, the better it is.&

When you have just bought a fish, dont put it immediately in the aquarium. Lets place the small sack in the water for a quarter of an hour in the way that the water will be of the same temperature of those of the aquarium. Then, you add a little quantity of water in the small sack, and repeat this operation for four of five times in an half of an hour, until the water that you have add its more than those that were in the small sack. The longer you can make this operation, the better it is..
At this point, with the hairnet, take the fish and put it in the aquarium. The water in the small sack throw it away.&

You now that during the day the plants, if in a sufficient number, should produce enough oxygen even for the night. Also for this reason we dont have to exaggerate with the number of the fishes present in an aquarium. Generally its better one plant more and a fish less, especially if you are an  inexpert aquariofilum.&

Remember that sometimes you have to change the water of the aquarium. The frequency of doing that depends of many things, but if you change the 20% each every 15days it should be ok. In reality, giving for sure the good working f the filter, the necessity of changing of water is mainly due to the increase of  nitrates; this increase is strictly bound to the number of the guests that you have in the bathtub, to the eventual vegetation, to the quantity of fodder that you give to the fishes.&

When you want to put in some gravel o some little stones, to be sure not to make mistakes, follow this simple procedure. Pour on some drop of muriatic acid, than see what happens; if it fries, than that means that is rich of calcium and it isnt necessary to put it in an aquarium of fresh water, if nevertheless it doesnt happen anything then, more or less, its ok.
Attention: it could have percentages of others metals as iron, etc, that could pollute the water.&

The most useful test for the aquarium are those for the pH, the gH and the nitrites. If you want to deepen the controls there are also nitrates, the conductivity  and the iron. Pay attention to the type of light that you use to confront the colour of the liquid in the test-tube, its advisable to do this measurements  to the morning light, the artificial light might false the confront to the liquid and the reference colour.&

The normal values of the water for an aquarium of community are pH7, GH10, KH 3, absent nitrates, nitrates < 25mg/l, temperature around the 26degrees.
This values are good for the main part of the fishes but not for all of them. Remember to inform yourself always, when you buy a fish, of its own requirements.&

Dont buy at the supermarket demineralised water for irons! Usually the demineralised water the we buy at the supermarket is produced by passing the water of the tap through cationic and anionic resins that withholds all the salts.
The regeneration of those resins is made of caustic soda and hydrochloric acid (it depends of the resin) and if the resins arent well re-washed, it will be troubles for the fishes.
The water the you find in a shop usually is produced by inverse osmosis (and then it cant be named distilled) and hasnt the problem over explained.&

Osmosis water. The correct term it would be inverse osmosis water or RO water (Reverse Osmosis). Its a water purification system that, taking advantage of the pressure of the pipes (or of the pump if this isnt enough) makes a part of the water pass through an osmotic membrane but in the contrary sense from that one in which it goes naturally. To be precise, having a water rich of salts as that one of the tap, an a water theoretically pure as the distilled one at the other part of the membrane the osmotic pressure would push the second to cross the membrane to join to the first one. But seen that we want to obtain the second one, we will have to applicate  a pressure such as the flow goes in the contrary sense passing through the membrane that one of the tap, but without the main part of the salts and various slags. The advantage is to obtain an excellent water for the aquariumfilia , even though to enrich  with eventual pads or to cut with the tap water. If the system of osmosis is good, we can obtain KH and GH at 0 and en elimination between the 95 and the 99% of all the rest as phosphates, nitrates, silicates, etc. Therefore its great to lower the hardness of the water of an aquarium.&

Dont introduce gassy mineral water in the aquarium!!! The idea of add gassy mineral water theoretically can be correct, but practically not. The reason, indeed, the reasons are very simple:
1) The cost (but you can also find mineral water that costs less than the osmosis water and of CO2            
     to add;
2) The real reason is that in this way of have a peak of CO2 at the added of the water, with a rapid  
     decrease in about little hours, due to the movement of the pump.
Result: stress for plants and fishes and any possibility for the plants to take advantage of  the CO2 added.&

Never use the water of exit of an air conditioner. The water that drip of an air conditioner system is rich of dust, smoke and various polluting that can be in the ambient. We also have to consider that this water condenses at the contact of the coils of aluminium or copper of  the air conditioner and therefore you risk to put in an aquarium water strongly polluted.&

The plants need carbon. The best source is represented from the CO2, but some plants when this is scarce, they succeed to take advantage of the sources of carbon more difficult to obtain that is the carbonates.
Since the elevated decalcification happens (that cause a lowering of the KH and an increase of the pH) needs a good quantity of light and of the plants very efficient in this process that are:

1. Dense elodea (the more efficient); 
2. Hygrophila;
3. Vallisneria;
4. Saggitaria.&

To eliminate the greasy patina that sometimes form itself on the surface of the water you can try to make a hole on the wall of the first bucket of the filter and put in a little grill of those that sold in the aquarium shops. In that way the water that is on the surface will go in the filter and it will be this to clean it.
Another way it that to have some floating plants as Ceratophyllum demersum. A more drastic way its to use some absorbent paper of kitchen, supporting it on the surface of the water and than to throwing it away, it removes also the patina. In all the cases we have to search to understand the reason why of this patina. Often it forms itself  when there are too many organic substances in the bathtub, its advisable to make a change of the water.&

For distinguishing the scalario males to females you have to know that the sexual dimorphism its evident only to adults and during the reproductive period. The male has a genital  papilla made as a tip, while the one of the female has more the shape of a trunk of a cone.&

It can happen that suddenly they form themselves some little white dots on the fins of the fishes. Its almost certainly Ichthyo (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis), its a ciliate protozoan quinte common in a fresh aquarium. Its caused by a protozoan parasite that enters in the skin of the fish because of an  weakening of it that cause a thinning of the mucus. Usually it happens for sudden changes of the temperature of the water, of cold; its just sufficient 1 or 2 degrees in the ark of 10minutes, and this parasite enters in the skin of the fish, and it inserts itself, prolifering and causing a cyst (the little white dots that you see) that when its arrived at the maturity it explodes and from one  are born some millions, that drops in the bottom of the aquarium where they expect that return the same weakened fish or another one and they  re-pass on him but in a thousand times greater number, and it goes on until they attached all the guests of the aquarium, also the stronger ones that cant make resistance to some thousand of protozoans.
If the disease isnt cured it causes a general epidemic and to the slow death of the guests of your aquarium. The cure is more simple to make than to tell (in fact its the most common disease): you have to use some blue of  methylene or green malachitethat you find in a shop of aquariumfilia  already prepared in apposite products. To using it at the best remove every active carbon that you have in the filter and raise the temperature to 27°, that reduces the cistation period in the guest fish. After 5 or 6 days of treatment it should be all solved.&

Sometimes in the discus we have in the head some skin lesions. Its the so-called hole sickness. We denote the disease, besides from the holes in the aforesaid zone, even for the effect of the white and mucillaginous faeces. Analyizing the faeces at the microscope, we find a considerable quantity of organism, more precisely flagellated, of consequence this means that in the intestine of the fish there are colony of  Hexamita, or others protozoans. The reason of this clinical summary is an insufficient contribution of nourishing vital substances caused to a monotonous alimentation. To be more precise a deficiency of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin d3 are responsible of the sickness of the hole.
The remedy consist in the radical changement of the quality of the fodder enriching the diet with the missed vitamins. But the changing of diet would help more the flagellates than our fishes, consequently, before, we have to eliminate the real cause, that is the intestinal parasitic.
There are three types of therapy. The first consists to subject the infected fishes of an encreasing of the temperature of the water. Every day the temperature is increased of 1° until a maximum value of 37°. After  reaching the maximum temperature, we immediately decrease of 1° each day until to restore the temperature used normally.This method demands termostato precise and one constant aeration with the porosa stone (inasmuch as oxygen and inversely proporziona them with the temperature.) the plants that eventually resist to these jolts of temperature are the Vallisneria, Echinodorus, Hygrophila, Ceratopteris, Crinum and Nymphaea. This method is still more effective if with to the elevation of the temperature it is made to lower also the pH.  The second therapy in order to fight the internal flaggelati ones of the Ciclidi is undoubtedly the metronidazolo. Drug used in human medicine in order to fight parasite of the genital ways urinarie them of the man, the drug demands the prescription obligatorily. Doses of the active principle: 1g/100 liters of water to one temperature of 33°c.  The third but not last one, indeed, is that one to use water cleaned up with pH lowest. This technique is that preferred one from who supports the oligotropico Aquarius acid. &

The female of guppy is ready for being put in the vaschetta in order to give birth when its belly is much large one. It is not easy to explain as to recognize the just day. A way can be to calculate that between a delivery and the other passes approximately 25 days. With the time you will sure succeed to recognize when precision of little hours is the just moment with one: -) However if you hold the female in the vaschetta for two or three days not are problems, the important is that you memories of cambiargli the water frequently. This is worth also for when there are the small. &

To decide when to remove the small pecilidi from the vaschetta it depends very of fish that you have in the bathtub. If you only have pecilidi them you can free after one ten of days. If you have other fish you will have to wait for that the small are piu' large of the mouth of the fish, otherwise will come exchanges to you for food. &

If the scalari have placed eggs, you can leave them where they are and hope in the cures ancestral celebrations.  Otherwise as soon as you see a leaf loaded with eggs, he immediately tries to isolate it, waiting for obviously that the male has made its must….  Without estrarla from the water, metila in one ciotola capiente, that it can inside be of the Aquarius. Obviously the nitrates do not have to be too much high, otherwise the avannotti are not born, and then, from 2° the day in then, you will notice only some eggs that become white women, not all, and to the third day it begins to shake something, and beginnings to catch a glimpse the codina, then the fourth day you see distinguished the tail that it moves, even if the egg still is attacked, and from 5° the day the first scalari begin to move.  In that moment, you must have a P2o of schiuditoi for artemie you go up some, in order to nourish the small… Initially you will see two eyes that they swim, and see that they have eaten because their belly becomes orange color artemia salt… &

The Corydoras goes periodically in surface in order to take “one air puff”: -) for which, on condition that they do not make it continuously, it can be normal. &

A volte gli scalari nuotano stando inclinati. Forse hai una sorgente di luce laterale all'acquari.
Di solito i pesci, soprattutto gli scalari, si orientano nella loro verticalità con l'angolo di incidenza della luce e pertanto, se questa non è verticale, tendono a stare obliqui.&

Sometimes it can capitare to notice that the fish have the smangiucchiate fins. If six sure that the fins have been eaten from some other fish and draft of an infection is not a problem. Ricrescono spontaneously, enough to have patience. They are not necessary specific cures. If, instead, not there are other guilty fish then, first of all, it must take part on the quality of the water with of the changes so as to to lower all the polluting substances. If this is not sufficient then it must take part with some curative one that can be found in commerce, but remembers that in a healthy water the fish are always healthy. &

It is often felt to say that in order to regulate itself on the amount of fish that can themselves be put in Aquarius it can follow the rule of 1 cm of every fish for 2,5 liters of water. This rule but is not credible. Like many other formulas that come used in acquariofilia also this are pure indicative. According to this rule we could put a fish of 50 cm or 25 fish from 2 cm in one Aquarius of 125 liters. In according to case it can go well but in the first one decidedly it is mistaken. The better rule is that one than to always inquire on the requirements and the compatibilities of the fish that we want to put in Aquarius. &

The problem of the lumachine… First of all is well to specify that if an Aquarius is held well, without giving too much mangime and without to leave too many leaves died to turn it is difficult that is an excessive number of the most useful lumachine. However, there are of the fish that eat to them, eccone some:  Botia Macracantha: they become 30 cm, they are many assets and frightening predators, bucano the leaves, during the first years are terribly sensitive to the Ictyo. They kill caridine, ampullarie, the guppy are to risk. Fish ball generally: much species is salmastre, bites the fins, predano the caridine, much species becomes beyond 20 cm and eats all i fish picccoli than they.  Badis: often they are lose interested in the snails, in compensation they demand alive, predano food the caridine (even if less of the previous fish) are calmer (and much less efficient) of the presci previous. &

The cause of alghe the filamentous greens is the phosphates. They eliminate with the changes water at least (even more frequent until when they come down to acceptable values). &

The eternal dilemma: areatore, areatore not. The answer is that the CO2 is a lot flown them and the superficial movement of the water which had to the areatore makes that “evaporates” diminishing of therefore the concentration. Siccome the plants use it for the photosynthesis the damage soon are said. In theory it could serve practically when, after some hours of lighting system, in bathtub an oxygen saturation is caught up, when look at the bollicine to go up from the leaves of the plants. Too much oxygen prevents the assumption of CO ² from part of the plants and, in this case the areatore would favor the expulsion of oxygen in excess from the water. However, in general terms, they are more against that for. &

As by now all know the plants need of CO2 in order to obtain the sugars of which they have need in order to grow (the production excesses come transforms to you in starch, corrispettivo of the fat person for the animals). This process needs of light and has like refuse product oxygen. But the plants breathe also they like all the living beings, where for respiration the oxidation of sugars (to level of mitocondri cellular) and the not pulmonary movement agrees. This process clearly happens 24 hours on 24. During the day produced oxygen is greater of that one consumed, of night the consumption diminishes but the production stops. The somministrazione of CO2 is therefore useless. We come to the pH: normally the somministrazione of CO2 favors the acidification of the water. The acidity is given from an excess of Ionian H+ regarding the OH-: the CO2 reacts with the water forming carbonic acid H2CO3 that is dissociated easy in H+ and HCO3- (or also in 2 X H+ and CO3- -) thus making to lower the pH. With a pHmetro connected to a elettrovalvola jolts of pH are avoided and the CO2 will come only distributed when there is need. However, in connected lack of a pHmetro to a elettrovalvola, he is advisable not to interrupt of night the somministrazione of CO2. &

Why every time that I buy a new piantina after little days that are in Aquarius falls nearly all the leaves? 
   Sometimes it succeeds that when you put in the Aquarius a new piantina, after little days fall nearly all the leaves. The plants that you have bought have been raised in idroponico atmosphere and not sott'acqua, therefore the leaves stretch marcire. It cuts them and you will see that between a P2o they will come some of various new… much from that you have had to cut… &

Some councils on the pruning of the plants     1. Plants with stalk, Cabomba type, Ammannia, Hygrophila etc: they go low cut, to the level of the ground or also more up, until one ten of cm., second the species. The moncone often it rejects, otherwise is extirpated, the tops go shortened and ripiantate. The better thing is not to make this operation all together: since typically they are leood in group is better to shorten only one fraction of the total, as an example 1/3, every time. Therefore the heights are always plants of all. From time to time dirada, eliminating the more ugly plants. All these plants grow very in a hurry, therefore the operations will be frequent.     2. Plants with leaves from the base, that they produce stoloni or similar, like Vallisneria: one lets to make alone, from time to time dirada eliminating the older plants. If they become high too much to many plants of this group they can “shorten” the leaves. Some members of this group, like the Cryptocoryne, do not demand cures.     3. Plants to cespo, like Echinodorus, used generally like solitary plants: diradano the leaves when it serves. The plant can be renewed many times over cutting all the leaves rasoterra. From time to time the plants are replaced reproducing them.     4. Plants with bulbs or rizomi, like Anubias, Aponogeton and Nimphaea: they demand treatments more “personalizes to you”, however the general rule is that from time to time it must extirpate them and divide the rizoma or separate bulbs, than sometimes demands a period of rest outside of the water.     5. Plants “to forelocks” like Moss of Giava: “the forelock with the scissors is sheared”, eventually dirada eliminating of a part.   The cuts must leave little possible matter marcescente, therefore fogliari cuts must be made the base or nearly, cuts on the stalks must be made (1 cm) to one gem near/node (therefore as an example cut to a Hygrophila *sopra* the node and the top ripiantare goes shortened until *sotto* a node). Practically what it succeeds is that the pruning leaves “the ugly” plants for a time P2o: the only thing is to take part to spin on all the plants, before that the situation becomes insopportabile, otherwise being taken part on all the plants at the same time the Aquarius appears “spennato” for long periods. An other thing: once that problems for “the too many” plants are had, best to begin to replace the species faster with the other calmest ones .&

In the plants as soon as bought introduce in vasetto one fiber glass that only serves for the transport and the stoccaggio in the store. When it arrives to house you remove it all accurately. Sure some root will be broken off but not to worry to you. If you put that wool in Aquarius it risks to pollute the water because of the substances that are within. &

It remembers that the law of the minimum of Liebig exists. Practically it is the reason for which the sometimes plants they do not want any to know to grow. Enough that one of the elements or oligoelements necessary to the rescita one of the plants is devoid that acts as from limiting factor. This is worth also for the light and the CO2. Therefore it is useless to put many lamps or much CO2 if then it lacks, as an example, the potassio. The plants will only grow until that they will have the potassio on hand after that will be stopped. &

Sometimes of alghe patinose of color the green-blue they can cover all like a film, Could be cianobatteri. The cianobatteri are the “ring of conjunction” between the bacteria and the plants greens (cloroplasti/chlorophyll). Also being “fotoautotrofe” as the plants greens and the alghe from the systematic point of view are he classifies to you with the bacteria but we see them like alghe: -) If six sure one that features of cianobatteri you have yourself piu' of a solution (we are speaking about sweet water Aquarius).  Before the test to make is that one to make to vary the value of pH (low), to increase the movement of the water and, if they are many bottoms, to raise the nitrate value.  If you have not resolved nothing you can try with the hydrogen peroxide. Mililiter of hydrogen peroxide to 10 or 12 volumes tries to put 1,2 (which find in pharmacy) every 10 liters of water for four days. Before putting it in bathtub you dilute it and pours slowly.  If still they are not talks nonsense you will have to pass to you then to the strong ways, to use an antibiotic. This is one what to only make if not there is other possibilita', is always better to still avoid medicinal in bathtub and of piu' when they are of antibiotics. The Eritrocina tries, is a medicinal one in tablets from 600 mg, these under is “instructions for the use” to follow exactly. The doses refer to the active principle  Day 1°) 2,5 mg/l Eritromicina  Day 2°) 2,5 mg/l Eritromicina  Day 3°) Pulizia and control values Aquarius  Day 4°) Change 50%+ 2,5 mg/l Eritromicina  Days 5-7) Pulizia and control values Aquarius  Day 8°) Change 30%+1 mg/l Eritromicina. &

In your Aquarius it could happen to find of the lumachine that scorrazzano indisturbate They are long not more than three/four millimeters and “they scramble up” of preference on the glasses of the bathtub.   The shell that form has? If it is to cone and probably you have of the melanoides tubercolatus, extremely prolific species ovovivipara is necessary that you remove the individuals manually (you begin from most large) and that someone holds under control their number in the time (as well as as for magic jumps always outside). If they are of those with the rounder shell, you can eliminate to them putting in the Aquarius a Botia Macracantha, before adopting this solution you must, but, estimating the prò and against. The Botia is a fish that catches up of the discreet dimensions, is sensitive to the temperature jolts and, in some cases, is intollerante towards the other fish. Therefore, to the end, it could be the case that the medicine is worse of the disease. The lumachine are also useful because they move the bottom, eat alghe and residual of food, of usual they do not damage the plants, the problem is that they soil like the fish and if in excessive number their weight on the equilibrium of the bathtub is made to feel. In order to reduce the number of the snails you take a pezzetto of meat, you insert it in bathtub after that you will have, to it, assured a thread that it allows you “to find again it”. Lasci the piece of meat in bathtub for some hour, after the extinction of the lights, dopodichè finds again it with the lumachine that will have been attacked over in order eating the meat. This method not you door to the elimination total of the lumachine, but, sure, allows you to hold the number under control. &

Sometimes understood that we must leave our Aquarius for some days for one vacation or other reasons. As far as the sweet water fish you can leave calm, can be also 10-15 days without food. Some day before leaving from a P2o more mangime of the usual (without to exaggerate in order not to pollute too much the water) and you will see that you will find again them all calm ones even if a P2o starves to you. If, instead, there is someone that can come to dargli of the mangime, you council of preparagli the doses to give, this in order to avoid to return to house and to find the jar empty because: “Poverini, has always hunger”: -) &

The water changes come made in order to eliminate the refusal substances that are accumulateed in Aquarius and/or in order to modify the parameters of the water in Aquarius and/or in order to add the substances that they come consumed and used from the fish. If in order to make the change the water of the tap is used is better to use a good biocondizionatore (removes heavy chlorine and metals and adds to oligoelements and colloids). The temperature of the water of the change must be the same one of the Aquarius and the change would go made more slowly possible. We define that one over as WATER STANDARD and try to use the change (made in slow way) also in order to modify the parameters of the Aquarius. Es. Aquarius of 100 liters with GH 2, KH 4, conductivity 200 ms/cm, nitrates 100 mg/l that I want to carry to GH 4, KH 4, conductivity 400, nitrates 50 mg/l. I preview a water change of 50 liters with WATER STANDARD (with nitrates = 0) I add in the water stand. it knows them of soccer and magnesium and port the GH to 6, I add bicarbonate for having KH 4, add water of sea reconstituted until having conductivity 600. I make the change and in the Aquarius I will have the parameters that I wanted (GH 4, KH 4, cond. 400 and nitrates 50) &

It can succeed that on the frontal wall of the Aquarius striscino of vermettini the small letters white men.   Sono Planarie, worms pertaining to the Phylum of the Platelminti (Turbellari class, Tricladi order).  They are not dangerous, except for avannotti of some species. They indicate but often a not perfect hygiene of the bathtub and in order to eliminate them is sometimes sufficient to improve the conditions generates them of the Aquarius. There are moreover numerous fish that of nutrono, one between all Trichogaster trichopterus!  P.S. If you notice the testina to triangle they are sure planarie. &

We see hour like preparing of the CO2 made in house. Draft to stir water, I leaven of beer and sugar. We go with order. First of all you must procurarti a plastic bottle from 1,5 liters, of those used for water or gassate drinks. You must make a hole in the stopper and, through this hole, make to pass to a small tube type those for areatori. With of the glue you must glue the small tube to the stopper so that not there are losses, you council some glue to component double quantity. To this point you put in the bottle a liter of water, a etto of sugar and a gram of I leaven. On purpose of I leaven you council that one in grains in order to make the peaks and salati cakies. The important is that it is I leaven of beer, is found to the supermarket for little Liras. I have said a gram but it does not import to be much precise, we say a teaspoon shaved from tea. You replace the stopper with the small tube and churns all the intruglio, careful not to make to go the liquid in the small tube. In bottom to the tube you put a porosa stone or something that can micronizzare the most possible bollicine than CO2 that usciranno, this stone, clearly, go put in the Aquarius. After a po of time (it depends on the temperature ambient, in summer are enough 10-12 hours, in winter want also two days to us) you will see that from the porosa stone they will begin to exit of the bollicine, is CO2. The mixture durera' of piu' if you add also a pair of sodium bicarbonate teaspoons, these serve to lower the acidita' of the liquid and therefore they make to last of piu' leavens. The efficiency of this system is tried and experimented from various acquariofili, but above all its economization is tried. The greater problem is in the tool that will be used for the spread. Better it is the micronizzazione of the bubbles of better CO2 will turn out the efficiency. A system of this type can be used in Aquarius who go from the 50 to the 120 liters. It goes held account that this production of CO2 is not constant, will have a slow beginning, will gradatamente go to increase in order then to recommence to diminish. A last thing, in order to avoid dangerous gone back of the water when the pressure of the CO2 is get exaustedded is advisable to put a valvolina not return in the small tube that goes from the Aquarius to the bottle. These valves can be found in the storees of Aquarius for little Euro. &

The CO2 in Aquarius is much profit in order to favor the photosynthesis of the plants and in order to lower the pH of the water. If there are many plants not there is need to interrupt it of night and the pH he remains however stable. In the event the plants were not many are necessary to control that not there are meaningful differences of pH between the period in which the lights they are ignited and that one in which they are extinguished. In the event there were is better to interrupt the distribution of the CO2 during the hours of buio. &

The infusorial ones are of the microorganisms that are formed in the water. They come used for feeding avanavannotti the first days of life. In order to make them you can put one banana peel in a container with of the water. If the water you have captured it from the Aquarius enough some day for having a cultivation of infusorial (in order accelerating it can put the container on the cover of the Aquarius in order to raise the temperature). When the water is torbid and begins to emanate a odore not many gradevole are ready. Precise dose does not exist one; I somministrerei 5 mililiter. of infusorial 2-3 times to the day. Obviously it must also often make water changes in the bathtub, we say a 20% a day yes and one not. The filter must be extinguished, otherwise “eats” all the infusorial ones. To the maximum it uses one of those sets in action to you from a areatore, regulated lessened. &

A fine sand bottom is much beautiful one to see and if you have the plants you will see that they will grow better. The problem of the anossiche zones only exists but if you make a bottom much high. We say that if you remain within a height of 6-7 cm you do not have no problem. If you want to make a bottom then piu' high it must that to every water change you move the bottom. &

The bacteria multiply themselves quickly, to the starter of the arrange-Aquarius, in proportion to the substances to biodegradare; a dispersed” increase is had generally “, that is the bacteria is scattered in the water. That happens also in case of excessive pulizie to the filter, or in case of pollution from mangime and/or animals died in bathtub: a effect-fog can be had, with lattescente and opaque water. In the successive phase, of maturation of the filter and the Aquarius generally, the bacteria surround of a mucillaginoso layer of particular substances (mucus-polisaccaridi) that it makes them to join an other and to the substrate on which they grow (enough to pass one hand on the internal surface of the glasses in order to feel them viscidi): the water schiarisce, the mechanical filter begins “to soil itself” withholding the finer particles. In the practical one, in order to resolve a foggy situation, if the Aquarius is in starter must alone have patience: continuous water changes only serve to extend the situation! If the manifest phenomenon later on, can is us of the material in excess smaltire (dead food or fish too much) and the bacteria increase like in an minium-starter; or they have been eliminates too many bacteria to you with pulizie of the too much intense filter or the bottom: the somministrazione of food is reduced and a pair of days expects that establishes a new equilibrium. One of the main problems of this “bacterial outbreak”, above all if he is rather important, pu' to be one sure deficiency of oxygen. it is therefore useful to oxygenate piu' possible the water. A good water change when this then is returned limpid or nearly can contribute to control accumulates it of the produced metaboliti ones from the bacteria. An other method in order to resolve the problem of the fog in bathtub, even if more expensive, is that one to use one sterilizzatrice lamp to ultraviolet. &

The GH measure the hardness of the water. Chemically measure the content of Ionian Ca++ (soccer) and Mg++ (magnesium) of the water. A lot piú the GH is high a lot piú the water is hard. Puó not to settle down the proportion between the 2 Ionian ones, simply the GH da' the content total. To es. it could be all soccer and therefore the water also having a numerical value of perfect GH for our fish could not be adapted and to produce diseases because it lacks magnesium. For this he is always advisable to add to a P2o of containing solution concimanti oligoelements and solutions for the plants (contain also knows them for the fish), in occasion of the water changes. The GH is increased adding knows them that they contain soccer and magnesium (to es. chloride of soccer, sulfate of soccer, magnesium sulfate, etc). We buy ourselves also in pharmacy with little migliaia of Liras to the Kg (with a Kg fairies the water for one life). To es. if in an Aquarius of 100 liters you have a GH 2 and you want to carry it to GH 4 you can make a water change of 25 liters that you have carried to GH 10 adding knows them of which over. The account intentionally is rendered banal, but it catches up the scope. You will have after the change a GH 4 in the Aquarius. The GH is diminished adding in Aquarius water RO (inverse osmosis) that it has GH 0. To es. if in an Aquarius of 100 liters you have GH 4 and you want to carry it to GH 2 you can make a water change of 50 liters with water RO. You will have after the change a GH 2 in the Aquarius. This that follows is a solution in order to raise the GH of the Aquarius without intaccare no other parameter (excluded the conductivity that it will stretch to increase in how much we add of knows them). Doses for 1 liter of water RO:  3 gr of soccer sulfate  1 gr of soccer chloride  1gr of magnesium sulfate  Puó to prepare one quantitá high in how much very well conserve. It is used adding it to the water of the change or directly in Aquarius in order to modify the GH. A lot is used some how much serves in order to obtain the intentional value. The important is always to proceed rather slowly, like every time that we make a change in Aquarius. In acquariofilia the hardness total measure in German degrees, the other fields measure in French degrees (Fº) for the present và comparazione held that 1º German correspond to approximately 1.79 French degrees and 1 French degree to approximately 0.56 German degrees. &

The KH measure the content in charges of coal of the Aquarius, indeed puó to say that tamponante measure the capacita' of the Aquarius in the comparisons of acids. The KH is important because its value influences the value of pH directly. The reaction is of equilibrium between charges of coal (CO3--) and bicarbonates (HCO3-): CO ² + H2O <=> H2CO3 <=> H+ + HCO3- <=> 2H+ + CO3--  Adding to acids (H+) the reaction it is moved towards left consuming the H+ and making useless our attempt to acidify the Aquarius. it is the same reaction of the effervescente Aspirin. The produced effervescenza is the CO ² that it is gone some from the water because the reaction has been pushed until the left extreme. It happens in less eclatante way also in our Aquarius.  A lot piú the KH is high a lot piú tamponerà the action of acids and fará to stretch the Aquarius towards neutral (7) or alkaline value of pH (greater value of 7).  Here because with high values much of KH even if we add to acids in Aquarius the effect is only temporary, after little hours the pH returns exactly where it was.  The KH often is influenced from the furnishings of the Aquarius. The ghiaietto it is often rich of charges of coal and it is in a position to yielding them in quantitá also massive for decades.  The KH is increased adding sodium bicarbonate (that one in order to make ........ the ruttini or to soften the verdure) To remember itself that it increases also the pH towards alkaline values.  The KH is diminished with the water changes made with water RO (inverse osmosis). Lowering the KH, the pH is not lowered. The Aquarius not tamponato becomes alone for which the insertion or the formations of acids in Aquarius produrrá a lowering of pH. This that follows is one solution in order to increase the KH of the Aquarius. Modification, clearly also the pH of the Aquarius, increasing it. Indeed creed that to raise the KH has a single sense if we want to increase also the pH, or however to render the little or not sensitive Aquarius to the acid action. It increases also the conduttivitá, while it does not come modified the GH Dose for 1 liter of water RO: 1,5 gr of sodium bicarbonate of puó preparing a good one quantitá, conserve enough well, at least for the use that we make some (I prepare also one here jerry can from 25 liters). One joins directly to the water of the change or in Aquarius. A lot is used some how much serves in order to catch up the intentional value. To remember itself that often, it depends on the aciditá of the Aquarius, although your additions you could not see increase of the KH, although repeated added. Continued because it is how much must normally happen. To a sure point it neutralizes acids to you, and when by now been for they give lost, you will begin to see the KH to you to increase and also the pH consequently. &

Conduttivitá the measure the content total of knows them in Aquarius. The GH measure soccer and magnesium, the KH the charges of coal, but remains not measurable all the others knows them (sodio, potassio, sulfates, chlorides, borati, ioduri, etc) that they are always present in water. Not da' the exact indication of everyone of they, but only the content total of knows them in Aquarius. The fish, often, are piú sensitive to modifications of the conduttivitá that not to the other parameters. Es. If it is put in a sweet water Aquarius with GH 5, KH 4, pH 6,8 good half chilo of chloride of sodio (NaCl) parameters over will remain the same ones, but the moriranno fish all. The conduttivitá but it would perceive immediately because it would measure also the NaCl and the value schizzerebbe towards mortal values them for the fish. The conduttivitá it influences the osmotici processes of the cells of the fish (and also of ours ..... pack-saddles to think next to ours polpastrelli when we hold the hands in water) and there are values to respect for every species. The conduttivitá it is increased adding knows them inorganic in water (if they contain soccer and magnesium aumenterá also the GH, if the KH contains charges of coal aumenterá also). If we want to increase the conduttivitá without meaningfully to modify the GH and the KH it convene to use reconstituted water of sea (using meager pipettes… quantitá).  If we want to diminish the conduttivitá they go uses water changes you with water RO. Council however to control conduttivitá of bought water RO that because often it does not have conduttivitá inferior to 50 µs/cm, for which it goes considered not equal to 0 in the calculations.  To es. in order diminishing the conduttivitá from 400 µs/cm to 200 µs/cm in an Aquarius of 100 liters enough to make a change with 50 liters of water RO. Eventually then remembered to recheck also the GH and the KH and to correct them. With little trying you will obtain exact parameters to you for everyone. &

What is the nitrites, the nitrates and the phosphates? They are the result of the transformations of the refusal products that are formed in continuation in Aquarius (made, food, parts vegetables, etc). The nitrites are most dangerous for the fish. Low concentrations kill also the sturdy fish piú. Fortunately a good filter and oculate somministrazioni of food makes that normally it is forgotten to us also to measure them. Attention to the new Aquarius where the not mature filter if does not succeed to oxidize them and the concentration in the water increases. Here because at the beginnig it convene to leave with little small fish, thus we give time to the filter to mature (inside increases to the concentration of the bacteria of the filter deputies to the oxidation of nitrites). The nitrites oxidize to you from the filter are transformed in nitrates. The nitrates are much less dangerous for the fish. Very inferior concentrations to 40 mg/l are tolerated. For resistant fish also concentrations until 100 mg/l are tolerated. The nitrates are accumulateed in Aquarius and the concentration with the water changes is diminished some. The phosphates are contained in all the organic substances and they are accumulateed in Aquarius. The concentration with the water changes is diminished some. Normally the nitrates are controlled only, also because it is the refusal substance that piú easy puó to catch up levels it elevates to you. &

pH da' neutral or basic the indication if the water is acida. Values acids are all those inferiors to 7.  Neutral value is pH = 7. Alkaline values are all those advanced ones to 7. The sweet water fish normally live in water piú or less acida (inferior value than pH to 7), excluded some species that they prefer neutral or leggermente alkaline values. Puó to introduce the occasion of having to acidify the Aquarius. All are Ionian substances acide those in a position to rilasciare H+ (are not just thus, but to the practical effects there is better to suppose that it is thus). Therefore in order to acidify an Aquarius inorganic acids can be used hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, organic etc) and acids (umici acids, fulvici acids, etc). Strong the inorganic acids are a lot piú and impose extreme precaution in the use. The organic acids are piú easy usable weak people and piú (torba rilascia the organic acids). Particular attention goes made on the value of the KH. For KH it elevates to you or in presence of ghiaietto that rilascia charges of coal we will not never succeed to acidify the water, if not for little hours, then all returns like before. It before convene to lower the KH and/or to remove the ghiaietto (to replace with quartz) and then to begin to acidify. Acidifying with inorganic acids it goes held of eye the value of the conduttivitá that it stretches to go up. With organic acids (torba ..... it is which personally I prefer) the conduttivitá does not come modified. Water RO to the practical effects does not have us acidifying effects, even if with pH inferior to 7. The CO2 acidifies, ago well to the plants, but it is a product of refusal for all the organisms animals for which puó not using itself beyond sure levels. &

Chemistry for the Aquarius is important! I make an example you: you now know that KH are the charges of coal, but this said therefore does not say a lot. If you know that but the charges of coal are a pad that limits the excursions of pH, you will understand that it can succeed with low KH (enough a nothing to you in order makes you to schizzare in on or in down the pH, with tragic consequences for the fish).  2°esempio: the definition of pH: the pH it is inverse of the logarithm of the concentration of Ionian the H+ (with sign the negative) in one solution. One could say… and then, than me frega, my fish are well without are schifezza.  Already the fact that is a logaritmica scale me helps to understand that between 7 and 8 (that difference of 10 times could seem a meager difference) exists one, between pH 6 and 8 >100 times, between pH 5 and 8---> thousand times. And many fish with period of adaptation succeed to become accustomed themselves to these abysmal differences. The human blood oscillates to the maximum between pH 7,35 and pH the 7,45 and already ends are pathological values. Thoughts to that it must make a poor one pesciolino in order to maintain to its pH ematico constant with massive variations therefore in the water in which it is dipped. Therefore chemistry is important in order to safeguard the health of the fish. &

Sometimes it can happen that the temperature of the water arrives alone until 28-30 degrees, even regarding the 26 that would go well for the species that we have. When we approach the Summer the temperature of our Aquarius know them also beyond the 30 degrees. For some fish, like the discus, it is not a problem, for others, instead, puó to be cause of serious consequences, as an example for Mediterranean Aquarius navy. The better solution is to add an air conditioner to the Aquarius. This solution is enough expensive and, if we have sweet water Aquarius tropical, we can make up for a P2o raising the cover so as to to favor the circulation of the air on the surface of the water, this increases the evaporation and with it avrá a lowering of the temperature. In order to increase this effect puó to aim a fan for the surface of the bathtub, clearly the evaporation of the advanced water sará. One recommendation: to always remember itself that the equipment electrical workers near the water can be dangerous therefore if you close put a fan to the bathtub insured to you that he is very stable and not is the risk that can fall within. &

In order to cool the water, not to put the ice! Beyond to injurious being for the fish for the cold currents that are formed are also little practical, in how much in order to obtain a sure cooling they are necessary important quantitati you of ice. As an example in order to lower the temperature of 1 liter of water of 1 °C they are necessary the approximately 12,5 g of ice (latent heat of fusion of the water is in fact of approximately 80 cal/g). Therefore if we wanted to lower, as an example, of 3 °C the temperature of 200 L of water we would have to use approximately 7,5 kg of ice!! And this without to hold account that meantime the continuous Aquarius to receive heat from the surrounding atmosphere, from the lights etc Instead the sure evaporation of a quantitative one of water puó to be piú effective, since the latent heat of evaporation is worth piu' or less 580 cal/g. In order to cool 1 L of water of 1 °C enough therefore to make to evaporate approximately 1,7 g of water. For the same previous example (200 L of water it cools you of 3 °C) is sufficient thus to succeed to evaporate little piú of 1 L of water (in realtá something of piú because also the air in which it comes made to evaporate the water cools little). Moreover the continuous evaporation that preferibilmente obtains by means of a ventilation of the surface and the rabbocco of simple water (from inverse osmosis) perhaps simpler and is prati us of the regular production and the ice refueling. &

The oligoelements are present elements in small amounts. Just for this it is stretched not to consider them, but in many cases they can instead be fundamental for various biological functions and chemistries. Moreover it can easy happen that they come consumes to you, also because present in small amounts. For this they would go reintegra you. Unfortunately their measurement is much difficult one, for which it rises the problem to understand when and how much reintegrar them, also because an excess of some of they could thus carry to problems like one they deficiency.  They exist reintegratori in commerce is for sweet water that marine. &

To measure the pH to the water of filtered osmosis or with I rendered some is useless. This water is nearly completely lacking in substances pad and therefore enough one small variation of CO2 for having of the jolts meant you of pH. If you want to be sure to have had of the good water you must measure the KH and the GH that will have to be to 0, better still to measure the conductivity that will have to be under the 50 µs/cm. &
